# Motivation and Background

<v-clicks>

- DNA has a very stable double helix structure 
- Typically Watson-Crick nucleotide pairing (A-T, C-G)
- Great for long term storage, needs to be unwound for biological usage via enzymes or heating
- Many techniques, notably PCR, rely on primers reliably binding to sections of DNA

# DNA Melting Temperature Prediction

<v-clicks>

- Melting temperature $T_m$ is defined as the temperature at which 50% of an oligo in solution is in ssDNA state.

- Many methods exist, gold standard is **nearest-neighbors**

- Gold standard has issues: not accounting for mismatches, formation of intermediate structures, etc
