# Lectures

Welcome to my PPT repository. This was originally developed by @ChristopherWMM for his lecturing and so I adapted a similar structure to host all of the presentations I give in one cohesive, accessible, location. 

## Overview

This repository will primarily be used to portably develop [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) presentations via GitHub Codespaces and act as a storage for normal powerpoint formats in PDF or ptpx form when I collaborate with those who aren't using Slidev.

Please check our @ChristopherWMM's original repository for instructions on how to replicate this workflow, and make sure to star and give him all of the credit for this amazing tool!
