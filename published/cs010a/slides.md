# Lab Expectations

- Be on time, attend every week. (Excessive lateness (>15 min) will get you points docked.)

- Work in pairs. (assigned by TA via icebreaker, randomly, or hat-pull)

- Complete lab exercise, turn in your pair's worksheet. 

- May leave once you are done or stay and work on your Zybooks labs and exercises.

- May attend another lab section **ONCE** per quarter. Make sure to notify us on EdSTEM

- I will be prompt about getting your lab exercise grades in.
