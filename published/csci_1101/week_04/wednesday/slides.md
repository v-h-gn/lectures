# String Slices

:: content ::

#### We have seen that strings are a little different from the other ==primitive== types..

<br>

#### They store multiple characters that we can access into using ==positions== or ==indices==..

<br>


|  C  |  h  |  r  |  i  |  s  |  t  |  o  |  p  |  h  |  e  |  r  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:18}}
name: str = "Christopher"

print(name[0], name[5:9]) # Access position 0 and access from 5 up until 9
```

# String Methods

:: content ::

#### We have also seen how we can use the `my_str.method()` syntax to ask questions and execute various behaviors on specific strings in using ==methods==!

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:13}}
name: str = "Christopher Martin"
search: str = "r"

print(f"{name} in all uppercase is {name.upper()}! Was it originally all upper? {name.isupper()}")
print(f"{name} in all lowercase is {name.lower()}! Was it originally all upper? {name.islower()}")
print(f"There are {name.count(search)} {search}'s in {name}")
if search in name:
  print(f"The first {search} is at position {name.find(search)}")

number_or_text: str = "54"
print(f"Is {number_or_text} all digits? {number_or_text.isdigit()}")
print(f"Is {number_or_text} all letters? {number_or_text.isalpha()}")
```

# Lists and Tuples

:: content ::

## ==Lists== and ==Tuples== work in the same way but they allow us to group any combination of things together in one variable!

- #### Lists are created by surrounding a comma separated sequence with brackets `[]`!

- #### Tuples are created by surrounding a sequence with parentheses `()`!

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:18}}
numbers: list[int] = [1, 3, 3, 7]
letters: tuple[str] = ("a", "c", "b", "a", "z")

print(numbers)
print(letters)
```

# Lists and Tuple Ordering

:: content ::

## Lists and Tuples store things in an ordered fashion just like strings!

### We can access individual items with slices and determine their length!

<br>

|  [`1`,  |  `3`,  |  `3`,  |  `7`]  |   |  (`"a"`,  |  `"c"`,  |  `"b"`,  |  `"a"`,  |  `"z"`)  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | - | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |   |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |  4  |

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:14}}
numbers: list[int] = [1, 3, 3, 7]
letters: tuple[str] = ("a", "c", "b", "a", "z")

print(numbers[0], numbers[1:], ": numbers has", len(numbers), "elements!")
print(letters[1], letters[2:], ": letters has", len(letters), "elements!")
```

# List Operators

:: content ::

## List support many of the same operators as strings!

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:12}}
list_1: list[int] = [1, 3, 7]
list_2: list[str] = ["two", "four", "six"]

# We can use the in operator to check if something is in a list
if 2 in list_1:
  print("2 is in list_1!")
else:
  print("2 is not in list_1!")

# We can compare lists together!
if list_1 == list_2:
  print("These two lists contain the same elements in the same order!")
else:
  print("Something is different about these two lists!")

# We can concatenate lists together into a new list!
print(list_1 + list_2)
```

# Tuple Operators

:: content ::

## Tuples support the same operators too!

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:12}}
tuple_1: tuple[float] = (2.0, 4.0, 6.0)
tuple_2: tuple[str] = (7, 3, 1)

# We can use the in operator to check if something is in a tuple
if 2 in tuple_1:
  print("2 is in tuple_1")
else:
  print("2 is not in tuple_1!")

# We can compare tuple together!
if tuple_1 == tuple_2:
  print("These two tuples contain the same elements in the same order!")
else:
  print("Something is different about these two tuples!")

# We can concatenate tuple together into a new tuple!
print(tuple_1 + tuple_2)
```

# Operator Incompatibility

:: content ::

## However, we can't always mix lists and tuples together..

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
my_list: list[float] = [2.0, 4.0]
my_tuple: tuple[float] = (2.0, 4.0)

# We can compare lists and tuples but they will never be equal!
if my_list == my_tuple:
  print("This can never happen ðŸ˜­")
else:
  print("One being a list and the other being a tuple makes them 'not equal'!")

# We can't concatenate lists and tuples together!
print(my_list + my_tuple)
```

# Wait.. these seem really similar..

## Why do we have both?

# Lists vs Tuples

:: left ::

# Lists

### Lists are ==mutable== collections

<br>

#### They <u>can</u> be modified after creation!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]

my_list[2] = 1
print(my_list)
```

:: right ::

# Tuples
### Tuples are ==immutable== collections

<br>

#### They <u>cannot</u> be modified after creation!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
my_tuple: tuple[int] = (1, 2, 3)

my_tuple[2] = 1
print(my_tuple)
```

| :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `my_list.append(v)`   | Adds the given value `v` to the end of `my_list` |
| `my_list.insert(i, v)`   | Adds the given value `v` to `my_list` at the index `i` |
| `my_list.remove(v)`   | Removes the first occurrence of the value `v` from `my_list` |
| `my_list.pop(i)`| Removes the element at the index `i` from `my_list` |
| `my_list.clear()`  | Removes everything from `my_list`  |
| `my_list.reverse()`  | Reverses the order of the elements in `my_list`  |
| `my_list.sort()`  | Attempts to sort everything in `my_list` in ascending order |

# Tuple Methods and additional List methods

<br>

:: content ::

### Tuples have some methods as well but nearly as many!

- #### Lists also have these methods too!

| Method              | Description                                                             |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `list_or_tuple.index(v)`  | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the value `v` in `list_or_tuple`  |
| `list_or_tuple.count(v)`  | Returns the number of occurrences of the value `v` in `list_or_tuple`          |
