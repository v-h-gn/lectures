### Today, we are going to review how we can have our programs interact with files on our computers

<br>

### This is very important and expands on the capabilities of our programs in a way similar to taking user input..

<br>

#### Allowing our programs to read and write data from external files greatly expands the ways our programs can use and produce data!

# Opening a File

:: content ::

## The first step involved with trying to read from or write to a file is opening it so our program has access to its data as a variable!

### We can accomplish this using the `open` function!

<br>

### The syntax template for the `open` function is as follows:

```python {monaco} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:18}}
with open(FILE_NAME, MODE, encoding="utf-8") as file:
  # Do something with the 'file' variable
```


- #### `FILE_NAME` can be the name or ==path== of a file or folder (called a directory)
  `open` assumes files exist inside the same directory as the folder you have open in VSCode
- #### `MODE` controls the operations we are capable of performing on the file
  We will review the specific values you can provide here shortly!
- #### `encoding="utf-8"` specifies how the data in the file is stored

# File Modes

:: content ::

| Mode | Description                                          | Caveats |
| :-----: | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
|  `"r"`  | Opens the file in <u>read-only</u>* mode from the beginning  | Fails if the file does not exist |
|  `"w"`  | Opens the file in <u>write-only</u>* mode from the beginning | Creates a new file  if it does not exist or overwrites the file if it exists |
|  `"a"`  | Opens the file in <u>write-only</u>* mode from the end       | Creates a new file if it does not exist |

<br>

### You can add a `+` to any mode to open the file in <u>read and write</u> mode
### This does not mean `"r+"`, `"w+"`, and `"a+"` are the same!

# FileNotFoundError

:: content ::

## You will get an error if you try to open something that can't be found
### Remember that `open` assumes the file / directory is within the current folder

<br>

### It is possible to get this error if the file exists somewhere else or not at all!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:18}}
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
  ...
```

<br>

#### If you see this error, make sure you double check the location, name, and extension!

# File Input

:: content ::

## The following methods can be used to extract data from a file
### These methods will fail if the file is not opened in read mode!

<br>

| Method        | Description             |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `file.read()`     | Reads and returns all remaining characters in `file` as a string |
| `file.read(n)`    | Reads and returns the next `n` characters of `file` as a string |
| `file.readline()` | Reads and returns all remaining characters in `file` until a newline is encountered as a string |
| `file.readlines()`| Reads and returns all remaining characters in `file` broken up by line as a list of strings |

# File Output

:: content ::

## The following methods can be used to write data to a file
### These methods will fail if the file is not opened in write mode!

<br>

| Method        | Description             |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `file.write(s)`     | Writes the given string `s` to `file` at the current cursor position |
| `file.writelines(l)`| Writes each of the strings in the given list `l` to `file` from the current cursor position |

# File Cursor

:: content ::

### The following methods can be used to manipulate the file cursor!

<br>

| Method            | Description                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `file.tell()`     | Returns the current file cursor position |
| `file.seek(p)`    | Changes the current file position to the character position `p` |
| `file.seek(w, p)` | Changes the current file position to the character position `p` relative to `w` |

<br>

#### `w` can have one of three values:
- `0`  -> From the beginning of the file
- `1` -> Relative to the current cursor position
- `2` -> From the end of the file

# Why is this important

:: content ::

## Similarly to user input, file input allows our programs to operate dynamically based on the data they are reading!
### This is especially good if we are dealing with a lot of data!

<br>
<br>

## File output allows us to save data when our program finish!


### Normally, all the state in our programs go away when it finishes executing!

<br>

### Saving state can be really useful, especially when we want data from a previous occurrence of the program to be used by future executions!

<br>

#### ==What are some examples of data that is saved between program executions?==
