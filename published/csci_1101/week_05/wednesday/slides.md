## Currently, our programs run down a path of execution from start to finish linearly..

<br>

### Each new topic seems to expand this somehow:

<br>

- #### Functions allowed us to "jump" up and run a previously defined block of code

- #### Conditional statements allowed us to introduce branching paths of execution so our programs could be more dynamic

# Range

:: content ::

#### `range` is a function that generates a sequence of numbers in three ways:

- #### `range(stop: int)`
  Generates a list of numbers from `0` up to but not including `stop`
- #### `range(start: int, stop: int)`
  Generates a list of numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop`
- #### `range(start: int, stop: int, step: int)`
  Generates a list of numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop` with a custom `step` size

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:13}}
print(list(range(10)))       # Every number From 0 up to but not including 10
print(list(range(3, 10)))    # Every number from 3 up to but not including 10
print(list(range(3, 10, 2))) # Every second number from 3 up to but not including 10
```

# Range Restrictions

:: content ::

### `range` requires that each parameter be an `int`!

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:14}}
print(list(range(3.0)))        # ❌ Not possible!
print(list(range(1, 10, 0.5))) # ❌ Not possible!
```

<br>

### `range` also assumes `start` is less than `end`!
```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:14}}
print(list(range(10, 3)))     # This doesn't create a decreasing range
print(list(range(10, 3, -1))) # The step to be manually set to a negative value for a decreasing range
```

# Looping

:: content ::

## ==Looping== is the act of asking the computer to repeat instructions

<br>

## Python has two types of loops, ==for== loops and ==while== loops

### In fact, most programming languages have these two types of loops!

<br>

## These two types of loops are equal in power!

### Anything you can do with one type can be expressed as the other type, albeit maybe not in exactly the same way

# For Loops

:: content ::

## For loops lend themselves to repeating a list of instructions a known number of times or _for_ every value in a collection..

<br>

### Their syntax is as follows:

```python {monaco} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:18}}
for ITERATOR in COLLECTION:
  Code we want to repeat
  ...
```

<br>

- #### `ITERATOR` is a variable that stores the current value from `COLLECTION`
  If you don't use the iterator variable, name it `_` or Pylint will complain! <twemoji-anguished-face />
- #### `COLLECTION` is a collection of sequential data that the loop is operating on
  This will usually be a string, list, tuple, dict (coming later), or range

# For Loops - Fixed Repetition

:: content ::

# We can use `range` to create a sequence of a known length!

### That means that, if we know how many times we need to loop in advance, we can use it to ensure we repeat code a specific number of times!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
for _ in range(5): # range(5) contains 5 values so we will repeat this code 5 times!
  print("Hello!", end=" ")

# Add a newline between the two loop outputs
print()

n: int = 10
for _ in range(n): # range(n) contains n values so we will repeat this code n times!
  print("Goodbye!", end=" ")
```

# For Loops - Iterators

:: content ::

# The iterator takes on each value in the collection
### We can use the values generated by `range` in the for loop using the iterator!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:14}}
n: int = 3
for num in range(n): # The name you choose for the iterator is up to you!
  print("Starting iteration")
  print(f"Doing some work! num is currently {num}")
  print("Ending iteration\n")
```

# For Loops - Collections

:: content ::

# We can also loop through collections of data!
### The iterator stores the values in the collection in order - one per ==iteration==
<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
name: str = "Chris"
numbers: tuple[float] = (1.5, 5.2, 6.8, -4.3)
cards: list[str] = ["2♣", "K♦", "6♠"]

for itr in numbers:
  print(f"itr is currently {itr}")
```

# For Loop - Nesting

:: content ::

# We can nest loops inside of other loops!
### We can also nest loops and conditional statements inside one another!

<br>

```python {monaco-run} {editorOptions: {lineNumbers:'on', fontSize:16}}
rows: int = 3
columns: int = 5

for row in range(rows):
  for column in range(columns):
    print(f"({row}, {column})", end=" ")
  print()
```

<br>

# Each outer loop iteration reruns the entire inner loop!
