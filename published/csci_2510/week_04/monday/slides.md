### Last class, we discussed <u>Trade Secrets</u>, <u>Trademarks</u> and <u>Service Marks</u>, and <u>Patents</u>..

<br>

### These are 3 of the 4 primary ways IP is protected but only cover a small subset of possible types of IP..

<br>
<br>

#### ==Under what circumstances should you use each of these three protection methods?==

<br>

#### ==What situations do these three protection methods not cover?==

# Copyright ©

:: content ::

# The last way IP can be protected is through ==Copyright==!

### Copyright protects works of ==tangible expression== and original authorship

<br>

### These include literately works, dramatic works, musical works, artistic works, educational works, architectural works, and programs!

<br>

#### In the US, copyright protections exist automatically from the moment of creation!
#### No special registration or work is necessary to receive protections!

<br>

#### ==What are some examples of tangible expression?==

<br>

#### ==How does it feel knowing most of your work is protected==
#### ==automatically without the need for explicit action?==

# Licensing

:: content ::

# As the holder of an IP copyright, you can choose to ==license== your IP in whatever way you want to whomever you want!

<br>

### This could include paying you, giving attribution, controlling what licensees can do with your work, as well as how they must license their adaptions!

<br>

### You can <u>write your own license</u> or <u>choose from popular standards</u> like ==CC==!

<br>

# As a consumer of copyrighted IP:
- ### You must always be aware of how copyrighted content is being licensed!

- ### You must be careful to not violate a license! You can request permission to use copyrighted content in any way other than it is publicly licensed!

#### ==Do you gravitate towards any of the Creative Commons licenses? If so, which? Why?==

<br>

#### ==If not, what do you not like about them?==

# Copyright Weaknesses

:: content ::

### Copyright <u>can not</u> protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation! Although, it may be able to protect the way these things are expressed.

<br>

### The duration of copyright protections are long but they <u>are not indefinite</u>!
#### Additionally, identifying the duration of copyrighted IP is somewhat complex..

<br>

### As of 1998, the current length for copyright is either:
- #### The life of the author(s) plus 70 years if the author(s) is/are known
  In the case of multiple authors, this rule applies to the last surviving author!
- #### 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation for anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire

### Whichever is ==shortest==!

# Fair Use

:: content ::

### ==Fair Use== is an exception to the protections granted by copyright which allows you to reproduce copyrighted IP without permission!

<br>

### <u>There is no _definite_ way to determine if something falls under fair use!</u>
### Courts make case-by-case rulings based on the following four factors:

- #### Purpose and Character
  What is the goal of the work? Is it commercial or is it nonprofit / educational?
- #### Nature of work
  Is the new work going to be published or unpublished? Is it creative or factual?
- #### Amount
  How much of the original work is being copied? The whole thing or a small portion?
- #### Market Impact
  Does the new work harm the sales and/or value of the original?

# Fair use is not straightforward..
#### To protect yourself, read agreements carefully and be cautious!

<br>

## For example:
### It is okay for a small bar to play music on the radio without explicit permission  but a large stadium can't!

<br>
<br>

### ==What are some pros and cons of fair use?==

<br>

### ==Is fair use a weakness of copyright or a strength?==

# Increasing Copyright Duration

:: content ::

# The duration of US copyright has gradually been extended!

<twemoji-world-map v-drag="[871,122,96,89,8]" />
<twemoji-books v-drag="[837,154,72,67]" />

<br>

### The ==Copyright Act of 1790== set the original duration at 14 years after publication with the option to renew once for an additional 14 years

<br>

### Amended in ==1831== changing the initial duration to 28 years, added protection for music, and allowed widows or children of dead authors to inherit and renew the copyright protections for the additional 14 years

<twemoji-musical-notes v-drag="[885,257,72,67]" />

<br>

### Amended in ==1870== to include the right to produce derivative works and
### add protections for make paintings, sculptures, and other fine arts

<twemoji-framed-picture v-drag="[898,351,72,67]" />
<twemoji-performing-arts v-drag="[867,381,72,67]" />

# Increasing Copyright Duration

:: content ::

### The ==Copyright Act of 1976== serves as the modern basis for copyright!
- #### Introduced the more modern definition of works of authorship
- #### Codified modern fair use and the ability transfer of copyright ownership
- #### Changed the duration of published works to be based on the lifetime of the creator plus 50 years or 75 from publication or 90 from creation for unpublished works
- #### Increased the renewal duration of older works from 28 years to 47 years (75 total)

<br>

### Finally, the ==Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998==, sometimes called the _"Mickey Mouse Protection Act"_, set the current durations we see

- #### Increased the renewal duration of older works from 47 years to 67 years (95 total)
  Delayed the expiry period of Disney's Steamboat Willie to 2024 instead of 2004!

# International Copyright Protections

:: content ::

# There are three primary ways IP is protected internationally!

<br>

### [Universal Copyright Convention (UCC)](https://wipolex-res.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/treaties/en/unesco1/trt_unesco1.pdf)
#### Requires minimum protection durations (25 years*)!

<br>

### [The Berne Convention of 1886 and the Paris Act of 1971](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201161/volume-1161-I-18338-English.pdf)
#### Requires automatic rights and minimum protection durations (50 years*)!

<br>

### [Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel2_e.htm)
#### International legal agreement between all members of the World Trade Organization
- #### Requires computer programs to be regarded as "literary works" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection as other literary works!
- #### Defers to the Paris revised Berne Convention*!


\* In most cases
