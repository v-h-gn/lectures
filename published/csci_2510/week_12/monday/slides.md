<br>

### In many cases, the federal government leaves privacy decisions up to the states

# NSA Access to Telephone Records 

:: content ::

## Edward Snowden leaked documents to the Guardian newspaper detailing that a FISA court had ordered Verizon to provide the NSA with all of it's telephone metadata for a 3-month period in 2013 (date, time, location, and length of call, but not contents of call)

<br>

#### In May of 2015, a federal court ruled NSA’s program was illegal!

<br>

#### In June, Congress passed a reform, called the USA Freedom Act, requiring agencies to obtain a court order before accessing metadata!

<br>

#### This paper discusses the possible implications: https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1508081113
