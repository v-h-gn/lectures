# Efforts to make Tech mature

:: content ::

## There have been efforts in the past to establish certifications and licensing in tech-related fields, but none have been successful..
### The most popular was to mimic the path taken by engineers in other disciplines, such as civil engineering:
- #### Four years of post-college work experience
- #### Pass Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam
- #### Pass discipline-specific Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam

<br>

Only 81 people nationwide took exam in first five years and it was discontinued..

### Many computer professionals hold responsibilities similar to those held by members of mature professions but without the same accountability!

<br>

#### Millions rely upon software rather than accountants to prepare their tax returns

<br>

#### Millions of people rely on system administrators to keep their work-related information secure

<br>

#### Software and hardware mistakes have cost trillions of dollars in damages along with an incalculable amount of mental, emotional, and physical harm plus loss of life!

# The Importance of Personal Responsibility

:: content ::

### The ability to cause harm to members of the public is a powerful reason why those in computer-related careers must act according to ethical principles!

<br>

### Without universal certification, licensing, and many of the other components of a mature profession to rely upon, people in computer-related careers must take personal responsibility and accountability for acting ethically!

<br>

## Organizations may have their own policies but none are universal!

### Laws and ethical policies only deter if three conditions are present:
- Fear of penalty
- Probability of being caught
- Probability of penalty being administered

# Professional Societies and their Codes fo Ethics

:: content ::

# Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
### Established in 1947 as "the world's first educational and scientific computing society" and is viewed as the primary professional society for tech-fields

<br>

# Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
### Established in 1884 by Edison, Bell, Tesla, Thomson, Houston, and Weston

<br>

### ACM and IEEE have the two most widely followed codes of ethics in tech!

<br>

## Let's look at both!
