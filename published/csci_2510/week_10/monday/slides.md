## Welcome back from Spring Vacation! <twemoji-sun />

<br>

### We start our module on privacy today!

<br>

### Some aspects of this module will be a little scary and will likely impact the way you view technology as a consumer and user of it..

<br>

### The goal in having these uncomfortable discussions is to show why privacy is important, the rights you have, and the rights your users should have!

<br> 

### ==What does it mean for something to be 'private'?==

# What is Privacy?

:: content ::

# Privacy
### The right to control information about ==oneself==!

<br>

## Many legal systems regard privacy as a ==fundamental== right!

<br>
<br>

## However, a "right to privacy" is never explicitly defined in neither the United States Constitution nor any of its Amendments..

<br>

### That being said, a "right to privacy" has been inferred in the United States primarily under Constitutional Amendments and Supreme Court cases!

<br>

### This is referred to as a ==penumbra right==!

# Privacy Rights

:: content ::

### Privacy law outlines the penumbra right of privacy which protects against unlawful governmental invasion and allows for civil action in response to damages caused by an unlawful invasion of privacy

<br>

### <u>The generally accepted privacy rights are the right to be free from</u>:
- #### Unwarranted publicity
- #### Unwarranted appropriation or exploitation of your personality
- #### Publicizing of private affairs with which the public has no legitimate concern
- #### Wrongful intrusion into private activities in such manner as to outrage or cause mental suffering, shame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities

### Privacy law in the US only applies when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, it grants effectively no protections in public areas!

# Dangers of Privacy

:: content ::

## I am sure we can agree that having a right to privacy is a good thing

<br>

### <u>However, there are downsides involved with protecting people's privacy:</u>

- ### Privacy can enable people to do things without taking accountability
- ### Privacy can prevent illegal behavior from being discovered and punished
- ### Privacy can result in people being cut off from others
- ### Privacy can result in failure to exchange ideas and to learn from others

## ==How can we achieve a balance between protecting people's privacy==
## ==while mitigating these downsides?==

## Let's review the different Constitutional Amendments!

<br>

#### Our goal is to think-like-a-lawyer <twemoji-eagle /> and identify which Constitutional Amendments have been used to define the right to privacy!

<br>

##### _I'll give you a hint - you can stop in 1868!_

<br>

#### ==Which Constitutional Amendments==
#### ==do you think impact privacy?==

<br>

#### ==Why those Amendments?==

<br>

#### ==What are the dangers of not having==
#### ==an explicitly defined right to privacy?==

# The 14th Amendment, Privacy, and Social Rights

:: content ::

### There are important connections between the 14th Amendment, the right to privacy, and social rights under ==due process== that I would like to highlight

<br>

#### My goal in bringing these connections up is to factually discuss implications of privacy you may not be aware of but could be impacted by - not to be political

<br>

#### <u>The following landmark social rights cases hinged on this idea of a right to  privacy:</u>

- #### Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) - Established the penumbra right to privacy
  Determined it is unconstitutional to criminalize the use of contraceptives
- #### Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)
  Determined it was* unconstitutional to criminalize women having a non-medically necessary abortion
- #### Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)
  Determined it is unconstitutional to criminalize same-sex sexual acts and ban same-sex marriage

# How is this all linked? Why are we discussing it?

:: content ::

## In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 

- ### The immediate impact of this decision is that the right to an abortion is no longer protected under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment

- ### However, the simplified reasoning primarily used to overturn Roe v. Wade was that the Due Process Clause does not protect the right to an abortion because that was not a "deeply rooted" belief of the ratifiers in 1868


- #### This decision can have serious repercussions from a social standpoint but also from a privacy standpoint - if the right to privacy was granted as a result of a decision that the use of contraceptives by married couples was private in 1965 and that was not "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition" and "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." in 1868, will that impact our right to privacy?
