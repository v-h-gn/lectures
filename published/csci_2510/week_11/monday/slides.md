### Now that we know what privacy is and how data is collected, we can discuss the risks involved!

<br>

#### ==Do you care about your preferences and interests being collected? Why or why not?==

<br>

#### ==Does a more personalized experience justify the loss of privacy? Why or why not?==

# Privacy Risks

:: content ::

# Our privacy is risked all the time in the personalized and convenient tech-focused world we live in!

### We constantly have to be wary of:

- #### The intentional and institutional overuse of personal information
- #### Unauthorized use or release by malicious insiders
- #### Inadvertent or accidental leakage of information
- #### The use of stolen or leaked information
- #### Our own carelessness


### ==Every leak, unauthorized access, and misuse is incredibly harmful! Why?==

# Privacy Concerns

:: content ::

## In many cases, we cannot protect information about ourselves!
  ##### We depend upon 3rd parties to protect it and they usually do not have our best interest in mind!

<br>

- #### Many people are not aware of invisible data collection, how their personal information is used, or how to stop it!

- #### Data collected for one purpose will find other uses!

- #### A collection of many small data points can provide a very detailed overall picture!

- #### Public information is available to everyone on the Internet and can last forever!

- #### Intentional and unintentional leaks / Data breaches happen all of the time and the public is not always made aware! 

- #### Governments can request sensitive personal information held by 3rd parties!

## Customer service centers use software to analyze a customer's words, categorize the customer's personality type, and help determine how the service agent can best respond to the customer.
### The system saves information associated with the customer's phone number so that on subsequent calls, the system can route the call to a service agent with a compatible personality.
- ### Is this analysis of the caller an unreasonable privacy intrusion?
- ### Why or why not?

## A children’s hospital collected and analyzed DNA from 100,000 children for a DNA database. The database is anonymous — the hospital does not store the DNA information with other information that identiﬁes the individual it came from.
- ### What are potential risks and problems?
- ### If you were the CIO of a hospital, would you have approved the project? Why or why not?
- ### As an individual, if you and your family were asked to provide DNA for the database, would you agree? Why or why not?
- ### Would it matter if the data was shared with researchers?
