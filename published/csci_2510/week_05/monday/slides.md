### So far, we have learned about IP as well as the different methods we can use to protect it..

<br>

#### However, much of this information has been focused on your giving you context and the necessary perspectives as consumers of IP and potential IP producers..

<br>

#### Now that we have that context, we we can discuss the implications IP has on the problems we solve, the code we right, the code we use, and the software we deploy!

<br>
<br>

#### ==What are differences between source code and executable software? Is this universal?==

<br>

#### ==What is an algorithm?==

# Copyright Restrictions

# Copyrighting Algorithms, Code, and/or Software

:: content ::

## Copyrighting algorithms, code, and/or software means protects
## <u>the expression of the idea, not the idea behind the expression</u>

<br>

- ### Copyright protects the creative expression in code, such as the specific arrangement of instructions, your variable names, and any comments..

- ### It does not protect the underlying approach or functionality itself!


## This is usually fine for software or object-code built from source code because the implementation details are obfuscated..

<br>

### However, it is much easier to extract technical details or an entire process from an algorithm or from source code!

### Due to this, many companies treat their algorithms and source code as trade secret..

<br>

### ==Why?==

# What does this mean for Software?

:: content ::

## If programs are protected under copyright, then it is important to understand what you actually "get" when you "buy" them

<br>

### In most cases, what you "get" is a license to use the software, not your own copy of the software with which you have IP rights over..

<br>
<br>

## Recall that copyright holders can license their content to whoever in whatever way they want - including letting you download it

<br>

### Again, this does not mean the copyright holder is giving up their rights to you unless expressly stated in their license..

# Software Licensing

:: content ::

## You are probably very familiar with these licenses even though you have _probably_ never read them before as either a:
- ### ==Terms of Service (ToS)==
  Governs the relationship between a business and its users as well as outlines general rules for service usage, user behavior, privacy policies, and dispute resolution (forced arbitration?)
- ### ==End-User License Agreement (EULA)==
  Governs the use of software such usage restriction as well as outlines licensing terms and intellectual property rights - tells you what you can and cannot do with the software
- ### ==Service-level agreement (SLA)==
  Governs a level of service a company must offer such as software performance or time to respond to issue raised by customers - important for cloud hosting

# Copyright Weaknesses

:: content ::

## There are two main categories of these ==shrink-wrap contracts==:

- ### ==Clickwrap==
  A pop-up agreement where you need to manually agree to terms to access the service or software
- ### ==Browserwrap==
  An agreement posted somewhere online, usually linked to within the service or software, that you agree to by proceeding to the service and are responsible to read at your own convenience

<br>

### ==What are your thoughts on these types of licensing agreements?==

<br>

### ==What is a situation where one is used more often than another?==

### DMCA and licenses often make it illegal to:

- #### Copy a program to give/sell to someone else
- #### Help other people bypass DRM
- #### Distributing a program over the Internet
- #### Preloading a program onto a device being sold (without permission)
- #### Copying a program you own to use at a different location (without permission)


<br>

### ==Do you agree with these stipulations?==

# Open Source and Code Copyright

:: content ::

### If you don't mind making your process available and only want to protect your implementation, you may decide to make your code ==Open Source==!

<br>

## Open source code is available for anyone to look at and/or use
### However a license may be attached to it

<br>

### ==Have you ever looked at Open Source code?==
