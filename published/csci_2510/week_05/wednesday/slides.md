### Last class we discussed how copyright applies to code and software as expressions of ideas..

<br>

#### However, the idea(s) behind those approaches is not protected under copyright!

<br>

#### In many cases, this leads to companies having to choose between protecting algorithms / approaches as ==Trade Secret== or with ==Patents==

# Important Court Cases

:: content ::

## Apple Computer v. Franklin Computer 1983
### Franklin Computer copied parts of Apple’s OS
### Established that compiled programs are copyrightable

<br>

## Sega v. Accolade 1992
### Accolade reverse engineered the Sega Genesis
### Established that disassembling object code to determine technical specifications is fair use

<br>

## Oracle v. Google 2021
### Google’s copying of 11,500 lines of source code from 37 Java API packages for Android constituted fair use and did not violated Oracle’s copyright

### A lot of open source APIs were written by studying commercial APIs and a lot of commercial APIs were written by studying open source APIs.

#### ==What do you think constitutes copying / infringement verses taking inspiration from?==

# Software Patents

:: content ::

# While it is possible to patent an approach to solving a problem programmatically, it must meet certain criteria!

- #### The approach must be unique
  You cannot patent something that has been previously disclosed
- #### The approach must have a practical use
  You cannot patent an abstract idea or process without it being used in a specific way
- #### The approach must be non-obvious
  You cannot patent a methodology that obviously improves over existing technology
- #### The approach must further / improve the capabilities of the machine

### It is not possible to patent a specific implementation or something vague like "software that does X, Y, Z" - the approach is what matters

# Software Patent Hesitation

:: content ::

## The United States Patent and Trademark Office refused  to grant software patents for many years
### Algorithms were seen as abstract mathematical processes!

- ### The "first" software patent was granted to Martin Goetz in 1968
  #### However, this dealt with sorting data across magnetic tape mainframe computers

- ### The other "first" software patent was granted to Satya Pal Asija in 1981 after a seven year-long legal battle and eventual Supreme Court decision
  #### Patented a natural-language-processing software called SwiftER

### In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled on Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank
#### The court held that implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patentable, they established a test requiring the addition of an "inventive concept"

### it took many years to get to the point where software was patentable!

<br>

### The 2014 Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank invalidated a lot of patents that weren't "inventive"!

<br>

#### ==Why do you think the government was so hesitate to give software patents?==

# Software Licenses and Open Source

:: content ::

### If you don't mind making your process available and only want to protect your implementation, you may decide to make your code ==Open Source==!

<br>

### ==What are some examples of software that is Open Source?==

<br>

### ==Would you ever work on Open Source software? Have you?==

<br>

### Recall, that source code is protected under copyright and you have the ability to control how others can use it via a license as a copyright holder!

<br>

## Open source code is available for anyone to look at and/or use
### However a license may be attached to it!

<br>

#### Last week we discussed Creative Common's licenses, these are used to protect copyrighted media but aren't typically used for code / software..

# Copyleft

:: content ::

## The most restrictive licenses are what we call ==copyleft== licenses
### CC-SA, GPL, and AGLP fall under this category!

<br>

### This is because they stipulate that any derivative works must be released under the same license

<br>

### However, GPL and AGPL also specify that the original source and all modifications of the derivative work are free and available!

<br>

#### ==Research the open source software examples and make note of their licenses==

<br>

#### ==Which license would you choose for the code you write and post as Open Source?==
