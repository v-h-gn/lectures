## What does it mean to *"own"* something?

<br>

### What rights do we have over the ==property== we own?

# Property Rights

:: content ::

# What rights does an owner have over a good?

### - The right to <u>use</u> the good

<br>

### - The right to <u>earn income</u> from the good

<br>

### - The right to <u>transfer ownership</u> of the good

<br>

### - The right to <u>abandon</u> the good

<br>

### - The right to <u>alter</u> or even <u>destroy</u> the good

<br>
<br>

## These makes sense for physical goods but what about intangible things like ideas, do we "own" those? Do we have the same rights?

# Intellectual Property

:: content ::

# ==Intellectual Property==, commonly referred to as just "IP", is a category of property that includes nontangible creations

<br>

### Treating IP in the same way as physical property recognizes the value of intelligent and artistic works which come from creativity, ideas, research, skills, labor, non-material efforts.

<br>

### Giving people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create also provides economic incentive as well as stimulates creation/invention!

# Examples of IP

:: content ::

# Some examples of IP are:
## - Inventions
## - Databases / datasets
## - Works of authorship
## - Trademarks / Service marks
## - Logos
## - Designs
## - Business or trade names
## - Commercial secrets
## - Computer software

<br>

### ==Why is it important that these things be protected and have ownership exerted over them?==

# Intellectual vs Physical property

:: content ::

<br>

# Physical property typically only has one “owner” at a time.

<br>

# Intellectual property can be copied and simultaneously owned by multiple people.

<br>

# Someone can reposes physical property that is stolen, but we cannot simply "take back" an idea..

<br>
<br>

# ==What are other ways IP is different from physical property?==

# Pros and Cons

:: content ::

# ==Is it harmful to keep the "usage" or "availability" of IP limited?==

<br>

### Society benefits when ideas are shared

<br>

### Prices fall when works enter the ==public domain== and when competition is available.

<br>
<br>

# ==Is there a one-size-fits-all ruling that can be made for how IP can be owned or used or do you think it varies?==

# Who owns an idea?

:: content ::


### The almost universal rule in the United States and other industrialized countries is that an employer owns the rights to ideas and inventions of employees — when the idea or invention was created by the employee on-the-job or when using the employer’s facilities, equipment, and/or data.

<br>

### As a result of this, Bowdoin College could potentially claim ownership over IP I create while teaching here!

<br>

### Similarly, Bowdoin College could also claim ownership over some of the IP you create while being a student here!

<br>

## You really need to check on a per-institution / employer basis!

# How does this relate to engineering?

:: content ::

#### As we talked about before, illegal copying is pervasive due to the Internet allowing copies to spread quickly and widely!

<br>

#### Global availability! (Think about international laws).

<br>

#### Digital goods are incredibly easy to copy and distribute.

<br>

#### With scanning and compression technology, creating perfect copies of large physical materials is possible.

<br>

#### Search engines make finding material easier!

<br>

#### Peer-to-peer technology makes sharing files without oversight possible!

<br>

#### ==AI can generate content, who owns the rights then? How to we prevent or detect?==
