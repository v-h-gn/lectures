## Last class, we came to the conclusion it is important to protect IP..

<br>

### However, we also determined different things need to be protected in different ways...

# Trade Secret

:: content ::

# The first way IP can be protected is as a ==Trade Secret==!

### A trade secret is a confidential piece of intellectual property that gives an individual or company a competitive advantage!

<br>

### In order for IP to qualify as a trade secret, it must meet the following three criteria as defined by the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996.

- #### The IP is must be information is that has either actual or potential economic value and is not generally known..

- #### The IP must have value to others who cannot legitimately obtain the information..

- #### The IP must be subject to _reasonable efforts_ to maintain its secrecy..

### <u>Trade secret protections don't expire if these three criteria are maintained!</u>

# Trade Secret Weaknesses

:: content ::

### ==Reverse engineering== is an allowed method to discover a trade secret!

<br>

### May be compromised when employees leave a company or if a falling out occurs resulting in information being leaked!

- #### ==Non-disclosure agreements== (NDAs) are legally enforceable contracts that create a confidential relationship between parties where one party has sensitive information and another party will gain access to that information

- #### NDAs count as showing _reasonable efforts_ towards maintain secrecy..

- #### However, human memory cannot be erased! An improved idea may be brought to a new company.

# Trade Secret Law

:: content ::

## The ==Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996== criminalizes trade theft under two sets of circumstances. <u>Economic espionage</u> and the <u>theft of trade interstate or foreign</u> are prosecuted by the Department of Justice and are punishable by imprisonment and/or fines.

<br>

## The ==Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) of 2016== amended the EEA to establish a private civil cause of action for the misappropriation of a trade secret.

<br>

### ==Have you ever had to sign an NDA?==

<br>

### ==How will NDAs and Trade Secrets affect / protect you?==

# Trademark™ and Service Mark℠

:: content ::

# The second way is with a ==Trademark== or ==Service Mark==!

### Trademarks are used to identify goods while Service Marks are used to identify services!


- The ™ symbol is used to identify an unregistered trademark!

- The ℠ symbol is used to identify an unregistered servicemark!


- The ® symbol is used to identify a federally registered trademark or service mark!

<br>

### Trademarks and service marks are registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office but it is up to the company to defend / protect the mark.

<br>

### This gives companies the ability to establish a “brand name” which gives confidence / preference to customers!

# Trademark Weaknesses

:: content ::


## So long as the mark is defended, the protection never expires!

<br>

### However, if brand's name becomes common noun, the mark may be lost!

- Companies can advertise to protect their trademarks keeping them known

- However, companies need to actively monitor their use and contact those who misuse them!

<br>

#### The ==Lanham Act of 1946== is the primary federal trademark statute of law in the United States. The Act prohibits several activities, including trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and false advertising!

<br>

#### ==What are some examples of a brand's name being so popular it is used as a noun?==

<br>

#### ==How will trademarks and service marks affect / protect you?==

# Patent

:: content ::

# The third way IP can be protected is with a ==Patent==!

### Patents offers protection for a limited period of time to the creators of machines, systems, and other inventions.

<br>

## They require a public document that provides detailed description of an invention!

<br>

## They provide owners with exclusive rights for 15 to 25 years depending on the type of patent (design, utility, pharmaceutical)!

<br>

### ==Patent licensing== assigns the ownership of a patent to a third party such that they can make, use, and sell your invention either exclusively or non-exclusively, for an amount of pre-decided royalties.

#### Allows an individual to make profit by selling the idea to a company!

# Patent Weaknesses

:: content ::

# Getting a patent is a very lengthy process defined by the ==Patent Act (35 U.S. Code)==.

<br>

# Your invention must be completely unique! It can not have been described, used, or patented by someone else!
### Requires a patent attorney and time to get!

<br>

# It is possible to apply for an International Patent but the process is more complex and your US patent is public!
