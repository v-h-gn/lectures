### So far, we have discussed many different responsibilities you need to have as a developer

<br>

#### During this module, we will look at the possible outcomes of failure to uphold those personal responsibilities and how failure to do so can result in lost time, lost money, injury, or even death!

<br>

#### We will discuss how system failures occur to learn how to avoid them, recognize the impacts system failure has had, and understand that system failure is often caused by more than one factor

# Safety vs Reliability

:: content ::

# Safety

### A system is safe if it ensures operation in the presence of potential hazards to users and the environment while mitigating the possibility of those hazards occurring

<br>

# Reliability
### A system is reliable if it is able to guarantee consistent performance while minimizing unexpected failures

<br>

#### ==Try to think of an example of the following:==
- ##### ==A system that is safe but unreliable==
- ##### ==A system that is unsafe but reliable==
- ##### ==A system that is safe and reliable==
