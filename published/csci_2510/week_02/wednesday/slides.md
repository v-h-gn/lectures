### In order to analyze situations and understand the ethical implications of our actions, we first need to discuss what it means for something to be ==ethical==...

# What does it mean to act *ethically* ?

:: content ::

<br>

# Let's begin with an example - speeding!

<br>

## Many people drive over the speed limit:

<br>

### ==Why do so many drivers break the law?==

<br>

### ==Is this an issue with the law? Should we change the law?==

<br>

### ==Would it be better if cars self-reported speed violations to law enforcement?==
### ==Why or why not?==

<br>

### ==How is this different from things like police radar and red light cameras?==

# Ambiguity

:: content ::

<br>

# Wait, there is a problem here..

<br>
<br>

## The same action may be considered *"right"* or *"wrong"* by different people based on who is involved and the underlying situation!

<br>
<br>

## This tells us that there is actually something more complex at play and we cannot judge each action as universally *"right"* or *"wrong"* !

# Morals, Ethics, and Laws

:: content ::

<br>

# There are actually three different (sometimes conflicting) axes to determine if something is *"right"* or *"wrong"*

<br>

## Actions can be:

- ## ==Morally== *"right"* or *"wrong"*

- ## ==Ethically== *"right"* or *"wrong"*

- ## ==Legally== *"right"* or *"wrong"*

<br>

### ==What do you think the differences between morals, ethics, and laws are?==

# Morals

:: content ::

# As an individual, you develop your own unique identity, experiences, and culture

<br>
<br>

# Part of your identity is an internal and personalized sense of *"right"* and *"wrong"*

<br>
<br>

# These individualized views are your ==morals==

# Ethics

:: content ::  

# As a member of a group, profession, or society, you follow shared principles and standards

<br>  
<br>  

# These collective guidelines define what is *"right"* and *"wrong"* in a given context

<br>  
<br>  

# These external standards that you subscribe to and enforce upon yourself are your ==ethics==

# Laws

:: content ::

# As a citizen, you are subject to rules created by governments to maintain order and justice

<br>
<br>

# These enforced rules determine what is *"legal"* (right) and *"illegal"* (wrong) in society

<br>
<br>

# These external and enforceable rules that are placed upon you are your ==laws==

# Conflicting axes

## What is morally, ethically, or legally *"right"* is not always the same..

<br>

## For example:

| Action | Moral | Ethical | Legal |
| :----- | :---: | :-----: | :---: |
| A Doctor treating a family member or friend |   <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>   |    <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>    |   <h2><twemoji-check-mark-button /></h2>   |
| A Journalist exposing corruption using leaked classified documents |   <h2><twemoji-check-mark-button /></h2>   |    <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>    |   <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>   |
| An Employee whistleblowing using confidential information |   <h2><twemoji-check-mark-button /></h2>   |    <h2><twemoji-check-mark-button /></h2>    |   <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>   |
| A Pharmaceutical Company price gouging necessary lifesaving drugs |   <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>   |    <h2><twemoji-cross-mark /></h2>    |   <h2><twemoji-check-mark-button /></h2>   |

# How does this relate to engineering?

:: content ::

## Suppose you are a software developer at a car manufacturing company and have been tasked with integrating a new low-cost computer controlled motor that could revolutionize the industry!

<br>

#### However, your project manager realizes the motor is not powerful enough to meet your design specifications if it uses the existing air filtration systems.

<br>

#### If you bypass the filtration system, it is possible the motor won't meet EPA air quality standards but it will definitely meet your design specifications.

# How does this relate to engineering?

:: content ::

## You do not have enough time to design a new filtration system before the project launch date and management says delaying the project is not an option.

<br>

## Your manager tells you to modify the system's software so the motor only fully utilizes the filtration system when the motor emissions are being tested.

<br>
<br>

### ==What do you do?==

# Possible courses of action:

- Leak the information to the local news because this illegal activity cannot continue!

- Talk with various levels of management and try to change the decision.
If that fails, go to the local news.

- Talk with various levels of management and try to change the decision.
If that fails, at least you tried.

- You try everything and if you fail, quit.

- Go along with management’s decision because it seemed like the other engineers were fine with it so it must be fine.

- Go along with the directive because you didn’t like the air quality standards anyway. They were too strict.

# Volkswagen Defeat Device

:: content ::

# This exact situation occurred at Volkswagen in 2009

<br>

### Volkswagen developed a "defeat device" that could intelligently enable the air filtration system only when motor emissions were being tested in an attempt to cut cost

<br>

### Almost 500,000 vehicles were sold with device.

<br>

### Tens of thousands of cars were “fixed” with only a software patch

<br>

### ==How will you prevent yourself from making the same decision==
### ==as the Volkswagen engineers?==

# Possible reasons that engineers would violate laws:

- Everybody is doing it
- It won’t affect anyone (probably)
- It is culturally acceptable in the industry/company
- it would be bad for me if I don’t do it
- I won’t get caught
- If I don't do it, someone else will
- The law is not enforced

# What about organization ethics?

:: content ::

<br>

## Do organizations have ethics? Written? Enforced? Shared by all?

<br>
<br>

## Ultimately, it is individuals who are making decisions and taking actions, or is it?

<br>
<br>

## Can we hold both the individuals and the organization responsible for their acts? When?
