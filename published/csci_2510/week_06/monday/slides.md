## During this new module, we will be discussing our responsibility to ensure the systems we develop are ==secure==..

<br>

### To do this, we need to first understand what types of vulnerabilities exist and how we can mitigate them!

<br>

#### ==What does "cybersecurity" consist of?==

<br>

#### ==What does it mean for something to "be secure" ?==

<br>

#### ==When do you think security matters?==

# Cybersecurity

# Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CICA)
### ==Cybersecurity== is the art of <u>protecting</u> networks, devices, and data from <u>unauthorized access or criminal use</u> and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information

<br>

### Consists of:
- #### Communication safety
- #### Prevention of intrusion
- #### Penetration testing (Ethical hacking) 
- #### Detection of intrusion and recovery

### ==What are some examples of security measures you are familiar with?==

# Cybersecurity Need!

:: content ::

## Many developers are not aware of proper security measures that need to be put into place to ensure the integrity of a system!

- ### Creating secure software is becoming increasingly difficult due to the growing complexity of modern technology!

- ### We don't teach it enough in general Computer Science or Software Engineering curriculum, many have to opt-in to Cybersecurity classes or majors to see the material to begin with!

- ### Many people view security of their platform as an afterthought!

## ==Have you ever talked about security in any of your classes?==
## ==If so, what did you discuss? If not, why do you think you haven't?==

### <u>We each have a responsibility!</u>

- #### Developers
  It is our responsibility to develop with security as a goal and understand possible vulnerabilities!
- #### Businesses
  It is their responsibility to use security tools and monitor their systems to prevent attacks!
- #### Users
  It is their responsibility to ask questions and educate themselves on the tools to maintain security (personal firewalls, anti-virus, and anti-spyware).

<br>

#### ==How aware are you as a developer?==

<br>

#### ==How aware are you as a user?==

<br>

#### ==Small businesses are often targets for "bad actors", why do you think that is?==

# Software Weaknesses

:: content ::

### The way we can gain a better awareness is by identifying the potential issues and weaknesses associated with software!

<br>

### The following factors are key contributors to the discrepancy between our needs and our understanding:

- #### Inherent complexity of computer systems
- #### Speed at which new applications develop
- #### Economic and business factors (save money)
- #### Human nature / human errors
- #### Attitudes about security were slow to catch up with the risks
- #### Security is often playing catch-up to ==hackers==
