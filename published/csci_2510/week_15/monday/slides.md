## Today we will be finishing up our module on safety and reliability 

<br>

### We have been discussing how/why system failures can occur as well as the unfortunate outcomes

<br>

#### In all of these cases, failure happened as a result of unknown issues but..

<br>

#### ==What is different about system failure when people <u>do</u> know about real or potential==
#### ==system flaws and try to expose them with no success?==

<br>

#### ==How do you imagine these attempts at making people aware of issues are received?==

#### All seven crew members on board the Challenger perished in the accident, including the first civilian, teacher Christa McAuliffe , who won a nationwide contest for teachers to be a part of the mission - evidence indicates at least some of the crew members survived the initial explosion but NASA had not included launch escape systems because the shuttle was deemed reliable enough

# Roger Boisjoly, Allan McDonald, and Morton Thiokol

:: content ::
## Morton Thiokol was an American aerospace and chemical engineering firm contracted by NASA to development and manufacture the Challenger's solid rocket boosters (SRBs)

- #### Roger Boisjoly and Allan McDonald, two engineers at Morton<br>Thiokol, documented the dangers of low-temperature rocket<br>launches due to a critical issue with the o-rings used to<br>connect the SRBs to the main fuel tank and the catastrophic<br>effect they could have at launch multiple times <u>months before<br>challenger launched</u>..

- #### Their executives at Morton Thiokol ignored their memos, but<br>eventually put together an investigation task force to look<br>into the issue - This task force had no power to fix the issue<br>for the upcoming Challenger launch

# Morton Thiokol and NASA

:: content ::
## Morton Thiokol brought this issue up to NASA officials during their launch "Go / No Go" meeting but NASA ignored the concerns and went forward with the launch to not delay the mission
- #### The Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch due to the issue<br>raised by Boisjoly resulting in the death of all 7 crew members
- #### That day, president Reagan launched a presidential commission<br>to investigate the cause of the explosion
- #### Boisjoly, shared this information with the Presidential Challenger<br>commission that was investigating the shuttle failure calling the<br>NASA/Thiokol committee an "unethical decision-making forum<br>resulting from intense customer intimidation."

#### After the disaster, Boisjoly suffered from insomnia, depression, and severe headaches. Morton Thiokol retaliated and unassigned him from space work.

He was ostracized by his colleagues and managers. One colleague warned him, "If you wreck this company, I’m going to put my kids on your doorstep." He filed two lawsuits against Thiokol that were later dismissed. Boisjoly never worked as an engineer again but started his own forensic engineering firm to try to ensure nothing like the Challenger explosion happened again

# Whistleblowing

:: content ::

## Whistleblowing
### The lawful disclosure of information about activity within an organization that is deemed a violation of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety

<br>

### In many cases, whistleblowing occurs when an employee tries to report dangerous situation through authorized channels. They are then rebuffed or rebuked by their organization and feels obligated to make a disclosure through unauthorized channels

# Issues with blowing the whistle

:: content ::
## Corporate Response to Whistleblowing
- #### Whistleblowers are disloyal
- #### Whistleblowers bring harm to a company
- #### Whistleblowers bring bad publicity
- #### Whistleblowers cause a disruption of an organization's social fabric and make it hard for people to work as team

<br>

### Whistleblowers are legally protected, but they can face repercussions:
#### They could lose job or all chances of advancement, be blacklisted in that industry, face financial and/or emotional hardship, face civil lawsuits

<br>

### ==Is this fair?==

### Richard DeGeorge's questions for whistleblowing:
- Is serious harm to the public at stake?
- Have you told your manager?
- Have you tried every possible inside channel?
- Do you have persuasive documented evidence?
- Are you sure whistleblowing will work?
